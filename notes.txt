In the current structure of the app;

We have three services: Post service, Comments Service and Query Service.

We have an event bus. When one of this services is used Event bus receives this information and informs the other services about what happened.

For instance, when a user creates a comments to a post; Event-bus receives this information and notifies the query and post service about it.Then the query service will  provide full listing of posts and relevant comments.



A diagram that shows flow between services will be added soon.


as of 21.12.2022 ; App has  query , moderation , posts , comments and event-bus services. In case query service breaks down , new comments  or posts will not be moderated,
however as soon as query service is up and running again ; everything that happened in the absence of query service will be checked and moderated if necessary.


Current state of the app 23.12.2022:  Each of microservices has been dockerized in automated manner with main.py file. This file contains a script that build images for each service and runs them.Has a function to stop all active services upon request.

Next up: Kubernetes
