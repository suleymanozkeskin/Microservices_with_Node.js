In the current structure of the app;

We have three services: Post service, Comments Service and Query Service.

We have an event bus. When one of this services is used Event bus receives this information and informs the other services about what happened.

For instance, when a user creates a comments to a post; Event-bus receives this information and notifies the query and post service about it.Then the query service will  provide full listing of posts and relevant comments.
